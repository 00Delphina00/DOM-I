## Beginning Project
 * You'll be working in the `digital_timer` directory
 * Add your script tag into you index.html
 * You can open your `index.html` file in your browser to see your work, but you may also work in codepen.io first if you'd like
 * All your work will be done in `index.js`
 * Make sure to read both the `index.html` and `styles.css` files so that you know what you're working with
 * Organization of your code in `index.js` will be up to you. There will be suggestions provided later in the day
